<!-- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. -->

You're scared.

So how do you keep yourself safe? You need information about these crimes and villians to keep yourself, your family and friends safe from the dangers of this city. You want to know what the police can do to keep you safe and how we're keeping you safe. You can also tell us any information you have on these crimes and villians so we can preemptively investigate them and arrest them before they can hurt you.

With the Gotham City Police Department Revamped Website,you can do all that and more! Our number 1 priority is keeping you the civilian out of harm's way because you're an important part of our community!

## Design Process

<!-- Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. -->

* The audience of this website is the innocent citizens of Gotham City
* The external user goal is for the citizens to find information about the kinds of crimes that are happening currently via a news and upate feature and the villians that are running about via a most wanted feature so that they can keep themselves safe
* The site user goal is to lessen to the effects of crime on Gotham's population by making people more aware of the crimes and villains currently so that causalities lost and impact of the damage is lesser

## Testing

<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
