            <p class="description">The Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) was founded in 1820.<br>In the past, the GCPD was deeply corrupted until James Gordon became Comissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed.<br>
            He has made Gotham City a safer place by consistently purging corrupted cops and by lowering the crime rate in Gotham City by 80% and erdicating<br>all orgnaised crime in Gotham City using the Dent Act.
            Currently, The GCPD consists of 62 precincts and all operations are directed by Commissioner Gordon.
            <br>The GCPD is one of the toughest police departments in the world as we have to deal with super-criminals on a regular basis.
