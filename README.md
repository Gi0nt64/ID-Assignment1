# Gotham City Police Department Revamped Website

<!-- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. -->

Everyone knows the reputation of Gotham City with its rampant crime and many terrifying villians. You live in this city with constant fear about what's the next horrifying thing that's gonna happen next. You don't know how to keep yourself safe.
You're scared.

So how do you keep yourself safe? You need information about these crimes and villians to keep yourself, your family and friends safe from the dangers of this city. You want to know what the police can do to keep you safe and how we're keeping you safe. You can also tell us any information you have on these crimes and villians so we can preemptively investigate them and arrest them before they can hurt you.

With the Gotham City Police Department Revamped Website,you can do all that and more! Our number 1 priority is keeping you the civilian out of harm's way because you're an important part of our community!

## Design Process

<!-- Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. -->

* The audience of this website is the innocent citizens of Gotham City
* The external user goal is for the citizens to find information about the kinds of crimes that are happening currently via a news and upate feature and the villians that are running about via a most wanted feature so that they can keep themselves safe
* The site user goal is to lessen to the effects of crime on Gotham's population by making people more aware of the crimes and villains currently so that causalities lost and impact of the damage is lesser. Thus making the citizens feel safer living in Gotham City
* My project is the best way to achieve this as the police has the resources and information to provide my website with the best possible data on crimes happening in the city so that I can inform the public with reliable and accurate information about crimes to safeguard the citizen properly and well.
* List of user stories for the project:
* As a citizen, I want to keep myself safe from the criminals and villians in Gotham City, so that I alert and look out for those dangers. Thus, I would have a lesser chance of getting hurt or killed by them.
* As a police officer, I want to public informed on the crimes that are happening in the city, so that the citizens I protect and serve can avoid those dangers
* As a citizen, I want to be informed on the crimes happening in the city, so that I can avoid that area to prevent myself from being able to get hurt
* As a citizen, I want to be able to inform the police on suspicious activities that I've witnessed, so that the police can check it out and see if the person is a criminal or not a criminal and whether to arrest them
